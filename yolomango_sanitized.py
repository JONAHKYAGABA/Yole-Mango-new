# YOLOMANGO_NEW sanitized script
# All hardcoded API tokens and sensitive paths have been removed or replaced

from tqdm import tqdm
from pathlib import Path
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Make sure to use environment variables for sensitive credentials
# Example:
# ROBOFLOW_API_KEY = os.getenv("ROBOFLOW_API_KEY")

# You may have lines like the following in your script:
# api_key = "hf_abc123..."
# Replace them with:
# api_key = os.getenv("HF_API_KEY")

# Replace any Roboflow code that includes tokens like:
# rf = Roboflow(api_key="your_key")
# With:
# rf = Roboflow(api_key=os.getenv("ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"))

# You can set your API keys securely using:
# import os
# os.environ["ROBOFLOW_API_KEY"] = "your_key_here"  # Avoid this in production scripts; use .env or secret manager

# Sanitized placeholder for the full code
# Insert your image processing, dataset balancing, and augmentation pipeline here

# Ensure no credentials, tokens, usernames, or personal directory structures are left in the final script

print("Sanitized script loaded. Implement your YOLO Mango pipeline logic here.")
